particles-bukkit
================

A Bukkit plugin that allows learners of Japanese to guess the particles in sentences they take turns constructing.

To use, build the jar using 'mvn package', then install the resultant jar on a CraftBukkit-enabled server.

Once installed, the /part command becomes available in Minecraft.  Typing /part with no arguments will give you usage instructions.
