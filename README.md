particles-bukkit
================

Particle game for Minecraft in Japanese, built on top of Bukkit.

To use, build the jar using 'mvn package', then install the resultant jar on a CraftBukkit-enabled server.

Once installed, the /part command becomes available in Minecraft.  Typing /part with no arguments will give you usage instructions.
